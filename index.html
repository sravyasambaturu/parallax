        A story of a girl.
        <br>
        So young of age and out of this world.
        <br>
        With love she drives.
        <br>
        With love she thrives.
        <br>
        As time slowly tics by.
        <br>
        Excitement rises at the thoughts of freedom.
        <br>
        A gratefulness as she released from the cage so long held.
        <br>
        To a new kingdom, to a new homestead.
        <br>
        I want say as if I was their.
        <br>
        Yelling be free my little bird.
        <br>
        Be free.

            “Nature” is what we see— 
            The Hill—the Afternoon—
            <br>
            Squirrel—Eclipse— the Bumble bee— 
            <br>
            Nay—Nature is Heaven—
            Nature is what we hear—
            <br>
            The Bobolink—the Sea—
            Thunder—the Cricket—
            <br>
            Nay—Nature is Harmony—
            Nature is what we know—
            <br>
            Yet have no art to say—
            So impotent Our Wisdom is
            To her Simplicity.

        The night grows,
        The wind blows
        <br>
        Unseen stars
        from windows.
        <br>
        Tamed heights,
        Untrained eyes
        <br>
        see hope in
        city lights.
        <br>
        But my soul longs
        for starlights
        <br>
        with you
        by my side.
